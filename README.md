**ThePopGenulator**
============

The only population genetics simulation and analysis tool you will ever want to use.

.... Eventually. For now we'll be starting off with some basic functionality and building a robust and extensible application which will, in the future, enable it to be "The only population genetics simulation and analysis tool you will ever want to use".

## Contributing
This project uses the [Contributor Agreement](http://contributoragreements.org/) and a sign-off process similar to the [linux kernel sign-off procedure](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches).

Each pull request commit must include a signed-off-by line with your real name and email address, which indicates you agree to the CLA. A copy of which can be found in the contrib dir.

An easy way to sign-off is `git commit --signoff`  This requires git to be configured with your real name and email address.

There are several important points to this:

1. This is a contributor's license agreement (CLA), not a copyright assignment agreement (CAA). **You retain copyright** for any and all your contributions
2. You grant to Simurgy, Inc. a non-revocable, perpetual license to use and sub-license your contributions under an approved **open source license**, **not a proprietary license**
3. You promise that, to the best of your knowledge with reasonable due dilligence and due care, you have the right to submit your contributions and grant to us point 2.
4. Generally speaking, this makes contributing other open source code very complicated. Please avoid it by making use of other code as 3rd party packages only.
5. If you need your employer to complete the entity CLA, they must do so with a printed and signed copy. There is no signed-off-by option for entities.

Basically, we value and appreciate your contribution and respect your right to authorship of that contribution. Please understand though, you will be contributing parts to a larger whole, and we, as a whole, need freedom to operate in the best interest of the project and all of it's (hopefully) many contributors. Your contribution will always be open source. And you will always retain the right to do whatever you please with your contribution, including assigning your copyright to someone else if you so chose.

What we ask for is the assurance that once you contribute code, we can use it in perpetuity. And for the ability to change the open source license under which we distribute the project, and hence your contribution as part of that aggregated work.

The license currently chosen for the project is GPLv3. The most likely change of license would be to the Apache License 2.0, but that's wild speculation at this point and may never occur. If you are not alright with your contirbutions being licensed under a permissive license, then please do not contribute to the project, as we can not guarantee this in the future. Again, your contribution will always be open source licensed.

If any of this summary or explanation here in the README file conflicts with the project CLA, then the CLA takes precedence as the authoratative agreement.
